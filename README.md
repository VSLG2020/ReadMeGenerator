** Developer Story **
<AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project>

##
This is a  _command-line_ application that accepts _user input_

-WHEN prompted for information about my application repository
 a high-quality, professional ***README.md*** is generated with the _title_ of the project and sections entitled;
  Description,
   Table of Contents, 
   Installation, 
   Usage, 
   License, 
   Contributing, 
   Tests,
    and Languages.
-WHEN _project title_ is entered
this is displayed as the title of the **README**

-WHEN a [description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions] is entererd,  this information is added to the sections of the **README** entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests

WHEN choosing a _license_ for the application a  list of options is presented. 
followed by a _badge_

WHEN github, email or Url Links are presented you are able to follow the link.

The new **README.md** file is generated in its perspective folder (ie: the utils/dist)
